= Application =
An application of no particular version, running on a Runtime. The <<Runtime>> defines the packaging
format of the Application. For the Clapper Services Runtime, it is an ApplicationDescriptor which defines
which OSGi bundles, resources and OSGi framework to run.

= ApplicationDescriptor =
The ApplicationDescriptor defines how to assemble an <<Application>> for the <<Clapper Services Runtime>>.
It contains a manifest and lists of bundles, resources and signatures, all in accordance with the OSGi
Deployment Admin Specification 114.

= ApplicationInstance =
ApplicationInstance represents an <<Application>> of a particular version that has been started in a given
<<Stage>>. It is the interfacing handle for instance control, probes and events from the process(es).

= BundleDescriptor =
Defines an OSGi Bundle that can be installed. The Bundle itself may reside on an OBR, local file system or
networked locations.

= CellLocation =
A CellLocation is one or more data centers considered to be located at the same place. This could be
data centers within the same city or country, but from the application developers' point of view,
the exact data center isn't important.

= Cell =
A Cell is a logical grouping of one or more hosts located within the same data center. A host may belong to
more than one Cell.

= Clapper Services Runtime =
Clapper Services Runtime is the actual application that is started in the <<Container>>. This is known as the
default <<Runtime>>, and will launch an OSGi container and all configured <<Service Bundle>>.

= Container =
Container is an abstraction of a remote system that can be commissioned. Containers are pluggable, so that
it will be possible to deploy on many types of Clouds, including _naked_ Linux machines without an IaaS
or virtualization layer.


= InstancePool =
InstancePool contains one Application across 3..n Stages. An InstancePool is unaware whether the same Application
is part of another InstancePool, but there resources will be shared and if this set up is done, it is important
that compatibility between versions is maintained to the highest of standards. If isolation between InstancePools
are required, then different Cell should be defined.

= Service Bundle =
The <<Clapper Services Runtime>> can be configured to additionally make available OSGi bundles with any type
of OSGi services. These are called Service Bundles. They executed with elevated security permissions, same
platform permissions as the Clapper Services Runtime itself, but may contain its own additional constraints.

= Stage =
Stages are chained together within a data center. Each Stage is isolated from the other Stages. Typical
Stages are _dev_ -> _qa_ -> _prod_ and similar. <<Promotion>> is the concept of _moving_ a particular version
of an application from the current stage to the next one. There are two hardcoded stages, called <<Released>> stage
for all versions available, and the <<EndOfLife>> stage for versions that are no longer used.

If no other stages are defined, a promotion of a version in the Release stage will move the version to the
EndOfLife stage and no longer available in the Release stage.
